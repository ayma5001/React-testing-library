# Hello Developers✨😎

## Wondering about unit tests? Let me break it down. Developers rely on unit tests to verify that each part of their code functions correctly. That's exactly why I've crafted this demo. It's a straightforward login page built with React, designed to test the elements of this page. It covers the essentials of React Router, showcasing common features like links and titles, while also putting the login page through its paces with input forms, buttons, and even data fetching from an API.
